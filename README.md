# Background
The company Yellevate specializes in providing marketing services to other companies. Yellevate helps mid-sized companies to launch their marketing operations which includes things like email marketing, website development, content creation and others.

Yellevate uses data analytics to keep track of how well it helps companies improve their marketing operations. For instance, if a company approaches Yellevate to
help improve its online advertising operations, Yellevate tracks this by looking at email impressions, click-through rates, website traffic and other key performance indicators.

# Problem
For the past few years, Yellevate has been struggling with client disputes. Yellevate defines disputes as clients expressing dissatisfaction with the companyâ€™s
services and refusing to pay for them. This has been a huge financial burden for the company: statistically, nearly 20% of the disputes raised against Yellevate resulted in a payment opt-out. This has led to an approximate 5% annual loss of revenue (in USD). Management wants our team to help resolve the issue. Using data the company
collected about these disputes, we will have to identify their causes and come up with actionable strategies to solve them.

#Objectives
1. Understand how long the processing time to settle invoices for all clients
2. Determine processing time to settle all disputes among clients in all regions
3. Identify the region where most disputes are coming from and how huge the number is compared to other clients
4. Determine how much revenue is lost from disputes in 2020-2021
5. Determine how much revenue is being lost and from which country most of the revenue lost is coming from
